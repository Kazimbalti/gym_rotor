## Notes
This is a forked repository of [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), so that functionalities and environemtns are identical except we add two quadrotor models, rate control and ball bounding quadrotor model. Threfore, this repo only focuses on these models and please refer to [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) for more detail (e.g., installation, and other models).
